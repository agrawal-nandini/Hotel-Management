# Hotel-Management
Hotel Management System (HMS) is a system designed to facilitate the working and management of a hotel. It can include various components within itself such as Rooms Management, Guest Management, Desk Billing, Housekeeping Service Management, etc. In this project, we have emphasized upon Front Desk Management of a hotel and
have included the following elements in our system - 
1. Room Management & Guest Management
2. Employee Management
3. Scheduling Activities of Hotel
4. Restaurant Management

In order to implement these constituents, we have made use of several data structures such as Graphs, Trees, Tries and Linked Lists. Apart from skillful and efficient use of these data structures along with their algorithms, we have also
implemented file management in several components
